# Tic-Tac-Toe(X&0)

Description:
This C# application is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game for two players, where one player plays as "X" and the other as "O". It is built using Windows Forms.

Features:

Allows two players to take turns placing their respective symbols ("X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid.
Tracks the progress of the game and determines the winner or a tie.
Provides a reset option to start a new game.

How to Use: 

Run the application.
Two players take turns clicking on the grid to place their symbols.
The game continues until one player wins or there's a tie.
Click the "OK" button in the message box to exit the game.

Additional Notes:

The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid of buttons.
The application tracks the progress of the game and checks for a winner after each move.
A tie occurs when all cells on the grid are filled with symbols and no player has won.
The "Reset" button allows players to start a new game at any time.
